    documentation="The initial launch of a Master Data effort is challenging and takes a lot of focus. The real benefits (operational efficiency, higher quality, better customer service) come once people and systems start using the Master Data. The overall effort has to include a roadmap for systems to adopt master values and identifiers as input to processes. Establish unidirectional closed loops between systems to maintain consistency of values across systems."/>
