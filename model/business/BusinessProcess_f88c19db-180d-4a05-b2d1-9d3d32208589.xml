    documentation="Master Data Management is a data integration process. To achieve consistent results and to manage the integration of new sources as an organization expands, it is necessary to model the data within subject areas. A logical or canonical model can be defined over the subject areas within the data-sharing hub. This would allow establishment of enterprise level definitions of subject area entities and attributes. (See Chapters 5 and 8.)"/>
