    documentation="Technical solutions can do remarkable work matching, merging, and managing identifiers for master records. However, the process also requires stewardship, not only to address records that fall out of the process, but also to remediate and improve the processes that cause them to fall out in the first place. MDM projects should account for resources required to support the ongoing quality of Master Data. There is a need to analyze records, provide feedback to source systems, and provide input that can be used to tune and improve the algorithms that drive the MDM solution."/>
