    documentation="This is the most common messaging pattern, also called request-reply. It has good&#xD;&#xA;support from a large amount of middleware. It is the equivalent of a one way pull and&#xD;&#xA;two way message exchange pattern (MEP) in terms of functionality and capability. It&#xD;&#xA;can be implemented either synchronously or asynchronously. When implemented&#xD;&#xA;asynchronously if the time between the request and response is significant, a separate&#xD;&#xA;signal message can be used to confirm the receipt of the request message."/>
